### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a security engineer. I currently primarily do penetration testing and cloud infrastructure assessments, but I'm always building something and I'm happiest at the intersection of infrastructure :building_construction:/applications :computer:/security :lock:. 

I contribute to OSS when I can, and have spent a lot of time mentoring/teaching/community building.
